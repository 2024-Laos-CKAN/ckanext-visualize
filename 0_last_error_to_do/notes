'dataset_resource.views' is the correct use of the routes
have to remove "controller action" (deprecated - pylons)
in dir: ...src/ckanext-visualize/ckanext/visualize/controllers
look up flask blueprints vs pylons controllers for generating routes

From Dusko:
For the admin part
Seems like nothing is overwritten
Only an action is added
So you can create a new blueprint with a new action and register it to the same route
And only the checks for before request treba have to be the same as the ones in the admin view
You can see how it was done here:
